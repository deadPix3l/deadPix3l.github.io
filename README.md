# deadPix3l.github.io

A mostly useless blog about nothing. and everything. but mostly code.
A place where I can post what I want. A place where I can build a profile for myself, ramble about anything,
post all those rants I'm tired of repeating, and share my adventures (or lack there of.)

### Pull requests
Most unbecoming of a blog, I am open to suggestions, format changes, new features, and yes, even posts.
If you have features, revisions to current posts, or new posts that you think are interesting, 
please submit a pull request. Please cite yourself as the author in any new posts.
I dont expect anybody will actually do this (because why not make your own blog?), 
but I will review all pull requests.

### Acknowledgements
This blog was made using Github Pages and the Monochrome theme from "The Review Index."
A few minor modifications have been made to the theme, including slimming down a lot of the code, 
and post-specific color changing headers, among other things.

Welcome to my blog. my currently empty and at the time of writing, themeless blog.
Chances are, the only one reading this, is me! 
Just how it works out, the internet is a big and scary place, 
and we cant all go around reading random peoples blogs.
Expecially the ones with no real point and no SEO (aka, me). like who are they kidding!

But if you are reading this and you arent me (!!!) then feel free to check out the rest,
view my github, there are plenty of neat projects there, and even say hey!
emails, messages and pull requests are totally welcome, just add "blog" 
or "github" in the subject/first message so that i actually read it xD

and if it's just me reading it, it makes a good reference for the past 
and somewhere to keep useful things. So what does it matter anyways i guess!

Welcome, and please, have a look around, hope you like what you find.

Okay, so this is more of a rant-type post. Most people reading this
probably understand intuitively most of the things I take issue with.
But, apparently not everyone understands these things, because multiple
senators asked questions that made me question how they could possibly
need to ask those questions. How is it they don't already understand
the answer. This will be a long post, so here we go.

First, Zuckerberg was lambasted several times about how long and legalese
the Terms of Service was. How could he possibly expect anyone to read that?!
What was he thinking?! Zuckerberg made it very clear that he doesn't expect
that anyone reads it fully, or even at all. Then why have it? 
BECAUSE IT'S LEGALLY REQUIRED IF THEY DON'T WANT TO BE SUED INTO OBLIVION! 
But why is it so hard to read, so lawyer speak?
BECAUSE IF IT WASN'T, IT WOULDN'T BE LEGALLY ENFORCABLE! I don't blame them
for making it so hard to read, they are just trying to not get sued into
the ground over every little thing. It's a "cover your ass" thing. He was asked
to rewrite it in a simple understandable language. If simple, easily understood
language was enforcable, then lawyers wouldn't write legal documents to be 
100 pages consisting of 12 syllable words.

Next question. Do you store users' data? Yes. *GASP!* Many of those questioning
him seemed appalled at the fact that facebook stores and SHARES user data! Guess what?
In order for people to see your posts, and pictures of your family, or your last meal,
or that funny dog meme, it must be shared with them. And for that to happen, it
must be stored on a server somewhere. Storing and sharing user data is literally
what facebook is made for. Another question was could he share someone's data without
consent. Yes he could. Not legally, or rightfully, but just physically, yes, he has
that capability. So does google, snapchat, Microsoft, the coffee shop down the street,
etc. If you have provided data to them, then they are physically capable of moving 
and sharing that data. This is why data breaches and government leaks happen.
Because it is physically possible. But Should he? Would he? Is it legal? 
Those are different questions, and I think that mix up was made quite a few times.

Should you have to get clear, explicit permission from users before you share
their data? Yup. and Zuck agrees. My main issue with this, is that by 
posting something to facebook, that is explicit permission to store it. Every
post you make, has a little button in the corner that decides who you want to see it.
So posting gives EXPLICIT permission to show it to those people! 
How is this hard to grasp?

Next. If I'm talking to a friend about chocolate, then I receive an ad about chocolate,
that looks like spying, no? Okay, this one is kind of legitmate and controversial. 
I would hope there is no spying happening, but if you were talking about a certain 
brand of chocolate, chances are you like that brand. You may have bought it before,
posted pictures of it titled "CHEAT DAY!!" or liked their facebook page so you can
express your love of the brand or learn when the new "Super vanilla mint" flavor gets
announced. My point, just because you were talking about it recently, doesn't mean
they're spying. You would have seen that ad even if you didn't have that discussion.
It's definitely something to look into, and make sure they aren't breaching our
privacy, but its quite possible it's just concidence and confirmation bias.

Which brings me to my next point. Somebody mentioned how we shouldnt allow racially
targetted ads. I agree to some extent. Racist ads are never okay, but sometimes it is
legitimately acceptable to market to certain races or colors of people. let me
give some examples. (Note: From a white speaker, any term relating to darker skinned
individuals can be polarizing. There is no racism present here, but I will not be
using the term "African American" because the internet is a global place, and
I am not assuming nationality. If you take issue with the terms I use, 
please recommend an alternative, and I will change it if appropriate.)

* A makeup company has received many complaints that their palest blend is not
pale enough, so they made a new, almost ghostly white color. Marketing this
specific color to darker skinned people will likely not net many sales. It seems
intuitive that pale colored makeup would sell best if advertised to pale colored
people, and the same goes for darker hues.

* Some companies are founded by and for people of a specific race. Their sales,
while not exclusive, or racist in nature, are made up primarily of that race. 
Companies frequently have to pay every time their ad is shown, and thus would
prefer it is only shown to people who are likely to click it. If a company sells
"BLACK LIVES MATTER" tshirts, and analytics reveal that most of their customers
are black, advertizing to white people could be seen as a waste of money. 
A company founded by a native american to sell native american style things, 
and celebrate their culture should be allowed to target native americans based 
on race in their ad campaign if they can prove that most of their customers are 
of native american heritage.

Next. Why can he not answer simple questions like "Can facebook track users even
when they arent't logged in?" Because these are not simple questions. They are very
complex questions, with many implications for wrong answers. Can they track nonlogged
in users? Yes. Anybody with a computer, a website, and a few free hours could. The
question was meant to be "DOES facebook track nonlogged in users?" Do they? Well, 
it can be complicated. When a company has grown to the size of facebook, acquired 
services like instagram, uses google analytics and advertisers, allows people to 
sign into other services or leave comments on other sites using facebook, eventually
tracking people, even accidentally can and will happen. Zuckerberg is not avoiding
the questions. He just wants to answer accurately, and 5 minutes per question may not
be enough to do that for questions he wasn't prepared for. This is not a defense of
facebook. I would like to not be tracked, but cookies, html local storage, partner 
services, location data, etc. can make it hard to tell when tracking does or
doesn't happen. These "simple" questions aren't so simple after all.

Closing points: There was a lot of talk about regulating Facebook. After watching
the hearings, I don't believe these people should be allowed to regulate Facebook
because they don't understand what it does. I do not believe any regulations they
would create could solve any problems better than industry leaders in Silicon Valley.
In fact, these regulations may even harm their ability to regulate themselves and 
cause more issues.

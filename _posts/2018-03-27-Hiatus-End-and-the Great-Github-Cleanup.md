Another post after a long, long hiatus. As far as I'm aware, nobody read these
posts. There's no reason to. I post infrequently and nothing of much interest.
But even if nobody reads it, it helps me organize my thoughts, marks my
milestones and goals, and gives me a place to host those thoughts I tend to
forget otherwise. So if you're here, Welcome and thank you, otherwise, posts
like these are just for me. I'm going to try to post more frequently, because
it helps me declutter my head, and my notebooks.

So onto the great GitHub cleanup! I like to write code. And I'm relatively good
at it I think. That said, I'm a terrible programmer. My style could do better.
I rarely follow PEP8. I don't run linters. I don't write unit tests or use CI
tools. These are all things that I would like to change. So I am going through
all of my repositories, deleting some of the more unnecessary ones, and moving
the code to Snippets if it is still desired. I will be linting my code, unit
testing, and using Travis CI. I hope to have a maintainable, searchable, and
testable codebase. Although the Snippets will probably be left alone. They are
junk code which do not belong anywhere else and need no testing.

So yea. Thanks for coming.

Finally! After much tinkering, the site is finally up, 
and while there's still some customizing to do, it's finally in a state where i can blog, 
and rant on all things code, security and etc to my heart's content. More changes will come later, 
as the code still drives me nuts. They say it's a 'easy, drop in theme - just deploy and go, no tinkering needed' 
but if I don't strip out everything I don't need and add a billion customizations, it'll drive me nuts. Guess I'm just like that. 
Anyways, hopefully it's comfortable enough that I will actually update here, whether it's just for myself, or sharing things with the world, or just somewhere I can link friends and co-workers to a certain rant of mine. 
That's all for now. Keep on the lookout for more posts to come.

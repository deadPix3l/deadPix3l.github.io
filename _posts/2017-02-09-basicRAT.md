Well hello! So, second post on this new blog that at the time of writing is still unstyled and non functional.
But hey, it'll be up eventually, i've got other things on my mind. What things you ask?
[BasicRAT!](https://github.com/vesche/basicRAT) A good friend of mine wrote a RAT, and after several contributions,
some complications, and still a ton of bugs, we got it reasonablly usable. i think. kinda. Anyways!!!
So it did blow up on /r/netsec for a bit and immediately gained a few hundred stars, which is kinda awesome!
Its great to be working on one of the leading open source RATs out there, and hopefully this project manages to evolve into something truly great.
If nothing else, ive learned a ton about sockets and threading, which is neat! I highly recommend checking out the project, contributing if you'd like
(pull requests welcome), and maybe follow my good friend [vesche](https://github.com/vesche), he frequently creates some cool projects.
Definitely worth. well, Happy Hacking!
